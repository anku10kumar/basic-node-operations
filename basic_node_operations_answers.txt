Questions

1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

Answer:

Sort- is a standard command line program of Unix-like operating systems, that prints the lines of its input or concatenation of all files listed in its argument list in sorted order. Sorting is done based on one or more sort keys extracted from each line of input. By default, the entire input is taken as sort key. Blank space is the default field separator.

output - returns the file sorted alphabetically by line.

WC-The program reads either standard input or a list of files and generates one or more of the following statistics: newline count, word count, and byte count. If a list of files is provided, both individual file and total statistics follow.

The output was  45     113    1035 commands.js

Uniq -

output - sorts each line in a file and only returns different lines. If there is a line in a file that is the same as a line above it, uniq removes it from the output.

2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

Answer: echo 'Bloc!' | wc >> commands.js outputted  1       1       6 in my commands.js file. I echoed 'Bloc' and piped the word count into the js file.
